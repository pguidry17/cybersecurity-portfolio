# Cybersecurity Portfolio — P. Guidry

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. I'm transitioning into cybersecurity after
10+ years of high-pressure operational leadership work in the hospitality industry.
This repo contains hands-on projects demonstrating my growing skills in:

- SOC investigations  
- Linux and Windows log analysis  
- SIEM fundamentals (Sentinel & Splunk)  
- Python scripting for security automation  
- Incident response documentation  
- Cybersecurity fundamentals and attack analysis

##  Incident Reports (SOC Case Studies)

### **Case 01 — SSH Brute Force → Reverse Shell (Linux Host)**
- Investigated brute-force SSH activity from 185.199.110.22  
- Identified successful unauthorized login  
- Detected privilege escalation attempts and a netcat reverse shell  
- Full incident report included

##  Log Analysis Projects

### **Linux Log Analysis**
- Authentication log investigations  
- Failed login triage  
- Suspicious activity pattern recognition  
➡️ Folder: `linux-log-analysis/`

### **Windows Event Log Analysis (In Progress)**
- Powershell event hunting  
- Execution chain analysis  
➡️ Folder: `windows-log-analysis/`

##  Python Security Tools (In Progress)
Simple automation tools to support SOC work:

- `failed-login-parser.py` — Parse and organize failed SSH login attempts  
- `ioc-extractor.py` — Pull suspicious IPs, domains, or patterns from logs  

➡️ Folder: `python-tools/`

---

##  SIEM Labs (Coming Soon)
Hands-on practice with:

- Microsoft Sentinel  
- Splunk alerts & dashboards  

➡️ Folder: `siem-labs/`

---

##  OT/ICS Security Exploration (Long-Term Goal)
Since I’m based in Houston and interested in energy-sector cybersecurity, I'm beginning
to explore industrial control system (ICS) security concepts.

➡️ Folder: `ot-ics-exploration/`

---

##  Current Career Goals
- Pass **CompTIA Security+**  
- Complete more SOC-style investigations  
- Build small Python security automation tools  
- Gain entry-level SOC or Cybersecurity Analyst role
